1. Credit Deduction
Credits would be deducted as soon as order is scheduled but in case order is not complete (driver is not assigned) 
then deducted amount would be credited back.

2. Tier 
No advance purchase is possible with Tier

3. Driver (Accept/Deny)
If driver denies then request would go to Admin to assign driver
(would not consider point 11 as it may take a lot of time while searching for driver and have driver accept the request)

4. No refund policy except no fulfilment condition.
Refund will be made when driver is not assigned for shceduled order
If order is not delivered (fulfilled) then driver and customer will discuss it offline - no refund would be made in this case

5. Schedule your Delivery 
Suppose customer scheduled order with 1 package but actual order was received with 2 packages.
How additional package cost would be charged from customer?

6. A to B Delivery
Will this be considered as enterprise level service and would it deduct the amount for packages and visits from existing packages for personal



--General things
1. There would not be any oversized package thing, those would be managed by means of Tiers and any package (including PayAsYouGo) 
can have oversize fee
2. There would be single PayAsYouGo package in entire system
3. All scheduled orders would be processed on date of schedule, no advance driver assignment
4. After driver is assigned(accepts the assignment), customer would have provision to deny the assigned driver. 
In this case admin would be notified and assign driver manually.
